# Can Meta-VQE beat Barren Plateaus?

In this project I plan to analyze if the Meta-VQE initialization can surpass the problem of barren plateaus. 
The first step of the project was to implement the Meta-VQE for pennylane and apply for solving the XXZ Hamiltonian, after implemented
I analyzed one of the gradients with the plain VQE implementation using random initialization.
